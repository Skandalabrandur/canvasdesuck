# Canvas Group Selection De-Suckifier

## Why?

Because Canvas Group Selection is slow and resource heavy

## Where?

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-group-selection-de/efdcolfjilgfiicmkomloleddoebemma

## Can I help?

Of course.
If you think of a great feature or make positive changes to look and feel, don't hesitate to contact me or do a pull request (though I might be slow to answer, scuse my tardiness)

## Will this repo change the extension automatically?

I will have to test this myself beforehand and I have not set up (nor will I set up) a system where it automatically updates the extension.
Google, for security reasons, may take up towards a day to accept new changes depending on their complexity/severity.

## Ok, you're not answering my pull request, dude, what's up?

Try contacting me via email: steinerinn@gmail.com
I check that semi-fairly-sometimes-regularly :P
